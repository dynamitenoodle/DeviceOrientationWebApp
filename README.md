# DeviceOrientationWebApp
Coehl Gleckner's IGME 230 Project 4

For my interactive web app, I plan to create a simple maze game utilizing device orientation. I plan on using the javascript canvas to draw my game onto the screen, and depending on the way you turn your device, it will interact with the ball in the maze. I plan on allowing you to set your default orientation, so you could play it with the default being face up on a table, have the default be straight towards you, or whatever direction you desire.

The three different versions of the project will be a simple maze puzzle, no difficult sections that serves to get you used to the way the game functions, a slightly more difficult version of it, where there a few moderately difficult sections to navigate through, and a much more difficult version that features a way to "lose" the game, like a pit that restarts you at the beginning of the game.

The game itself will feature you adding forces to the ball to move it around the screen, maybe you being able to shake the screen to jump the ball, and a button or something that allows you to recalibrate the default orientation of the game.

To learn how to create the game, I will use tutorials on how to use jquery UI, or javascript Canvas depending on which I deem more helpful to my cause, and how to properly implement the event listener for device orientation.
